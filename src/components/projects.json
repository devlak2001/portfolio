      "description": "We developed an interactive immersive factory inspired by LEGO that followed the journey of “Chuck,” our flawed protagonist, demonstrating how Intel’s AI tech improved efficiency, safety, and cost savings in manufacturing.

A narrator says, “Let’s see how this could have been prevented had we used Intel’s AI technology.”",
